/**
 * Given n numbers, each with some frequency of occurrence.
 * Return a random number with probability proportional to its frequency of occurrence.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Let following be the given numbers.
 *   arr[] = {10, 30, 20, 40}
 *
 * Let following be the frequencies of given numbers.
 *   freq[] = {1, 6, 2, 1}
 *
 * The output should be
 *   10 with probability 1/10
 *   30 with probability 6/10
 *   20 with probability 2/10
 *   40 with probability 1/10

 *
 * Method 1:
 * Huge memory consumption method:
 *
 * One simple method is to take an auxiliary array (say aux[]) and
 * duplicate the numbers according to their frequency of occurrence.
 * Generate a random number(say r) between 0 to Sum-1(including both),
 * where Sum represents summation of frequency array (freq[] in above example).
 * Return the random number aux[r].
 *
 * when frequency of occurrence is high. If the input is 997, 8761 and 1, this method is clearly not efficient.
 *
 * Method 2:
 * O(n) extra space where n is number of elements in input arrays.
 *
 * How can we reduce the memory consumption? Following is detailed algorithm that
 * uses O(n) extra space where n is number of elements in input arrays.
 *
 * 1.	Take an auxiliary array (say prefix[]) of size n.
 * 2.	Populate it with prefix sum, such that prefix[i] represents sum of numbers from 0 to i.
 * 3.	Generate a random number(say r) between 1 to Sum(including both), where Sum represents summation of input frequency array.
 * 4.	Find index of Ceil of random number generated in step #3 in the prefix array. Let the index be indexc.
 * 5.	Return the random number arr[indexc], where arr[] contains the input n numbers.
 *
 *   Before we go to the implementation part, let us have quick look at the algorithm with an example:
 *       arr[]: {10, 20, 30}
 *       freq[]: {2, 3, 1}
 *       Prefix[]: {2, 5, 6}
 *   Since last entry in prefix is 6, all possible values of r are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *          1: Ceil is 2. Random number generated is 10.
 *       2: Ceil is 2. Random number generated is 10.
 *          3: Ceil is 5. Random number generated is 20.
 *          4: Ceil is 5. Random number generated is 20.
 *          5: Ceil is 5. Random number generated is 20.
 *          6. Ceil is 6. Random number generated is 30.

     * If you hit a non-zero value, it's a statistically random value between 1 and 7,
     * since there are an equal number of non-zero values to choose from.
     * If you hit a zero, just keep throwing the dart until you hit a non-zero.
     * That's what this code is doing: the i and j indexes randomly select a location on the dart board,
     * and if we don't get a good result, we keep throwing darts.
